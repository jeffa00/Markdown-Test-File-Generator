#Markdown Test File Generator
I'm working on a couple of markdown related projects at the moment and I want to load test them with a metric crap load of markdown files.

The gist here is that it spins through and randomly puts together Lorem Ipsum dummy paragraphs and headings.

It also puts together an index file in json format.

This is a quicky quick tonight, but I'll be adding more later.
